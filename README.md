# Edlance
D-App for Freelancing in Education
-----------------------------------
The problem Edlance solves\
Field of Interest :\
EdTech: Help the field of education move from the dark ages to the golden age of technology.
Blockchain: Bring change to transactions and cryptocurrency with promising Blockchain solutions.

Problem Statement:\
As soon as the Pandemic hit the world came to a stand still. Education sector was one of the worst hit, due to lockdowns, 0 physical classes, reduced student-teacher interaction, and less to no Doubt Clearing sessions. Also, educators are affected no less by the pandemic. Since it's beginning though they were doing work from home, a lot of Educators lost their employment. Taking classes all day through a wifi connection also takes a toll on their pockets. Students in these times also feel like to contribute to their pocket money themselves.

Proposed System:\
A blockchain solution, connecting students to freelance educators whose livelihoods are impacted in the pandemic. In these tough times with no doubt clearance sessions and tough assignments,students are having a tough time coping up with stress. Our solution gives the students a perfect platform to ask questions to experts in real-time. Also peer sharing of solution helps students excel in the subjects of liking as well as earn money for it !. Through application of a trending education technique "Education by Gamification" (Peer answering resulting in real monetary rewards), motivates students to excel even more in their field of interest. Also with the bounty system we believe that much tougher questions can be asked through the postal and will attract many people to answer. Urgency of getting a question solved is also being addressed by our Bounty system, higher the need of answer higher the bounty you can keep.

Future Plans :
1. Upvote/downvote (for peer answers)
2. Auto upgrade account to Student Pro (calculation Based on their Peer answers)
3. Discussion panel (with Experts)
4. Additional knowledge sharing section (off-Topic)\
